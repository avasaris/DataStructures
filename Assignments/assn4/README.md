Assignment 4
------------
------------

In the assignment you will implement two fundamental Divide-and-Conquer sorting
algorithms, Quicksort and Mergesort, and measure their performance on data of various size and
consistency. In addition to your implementations of each, you will submit the findings of your
experimentation in a written report.

Quicksort
---------
---------

Implement a template function quicksort. Do not associate it with a class, rather implement it
as utility function in a file named Quicksort.H. Then #include Quicksort.H in your main.cc.
For debugging purposes initially use a random pivot. Once you are convinced the function sorts
correctly, extend the functionality to allow for the following pivots: First, Median Of Three, Random
Quick Select, and Deterministic Quick Select.

We must be able to call your function in the following manner:
vector<string> result = quicksort(v, pivot); – where v is an already defined vector of
strings and pivot, indicating which pivot is used, is a string that can have one of the following
values: first, random, median three, random qselect, or deterministic qsort. Similarly,
your function must also accept and return vectors of type int. We now describe each of the four
pivots in more detail.

First
-----
Pick the first element from the vector to be sorted. This element is the pivot.

Random
------
Randomly pick one element from the vector to be sorted. This element is the pivot.

Median Of Three
---------------
Randomly pick three elements from the vector to be sorted. The median of the three is the pivot.

Selection
---------
For any vector V of comparable values, let select(V,k) denote the kth smallest value in V, with select(V,1) being the smallest. Obviously, select(V,k) is the same as V[k-1] if and only if the values in V are in sorted order, which normally requires O(n log(n)) comparisons to achieve, where n denotes V.size(). We will present two versions of the QuickSelect algorithm. The randomized version has linear average-case complexity but requires n^2 comparisons in the worst case. The deterministic version has linear worst-case complexity but much higher overhead. 

* Median. The median of an odd number of values is the one in the middle. But, if there are an even number of values, there are two in the middle. Statisticians take the average of those two values, but computer scientists prefer to select one. When V.size() is even:
	> select( V, 1+V.size()/2 ) selects the larger of the two.1
	> select( V, (1+V.size())/2 ) selects the smaller of the two.

* But when V.size() is odd both expressions select the middle value. Both are equally valid, but the latter the more common definition:

<pre><code>template<T>
T median( vector<T>& V ) { return select( V, (1+V.size())/2 ); } </pre></code>

Random Quick Select
-------------------
To find select(V,k) via the randomized Quick Select algorithm:

* Assert that V is not empty and that k is between 1 and V.size(), inclusively.
* Pick a so-called “pivot” value, p, at random from V.
* Construct three new vectors L, E, and G containing, respectively, all entries of V that are Less than p, all entries that are Equal to p, and all entries that are Greater than p.
* If k <= L.size(), then select(V,k) must be in L, so return select(L,k), which, of course, involves a recursive call to select.
* Otherwise, if k <= L.size()+E.size(), then select(V,k) is surely in E, so simply return p.
* Otherwise, select(V,k) is surely in G, so decrement k by L.size()+E.size() and return the k-th smallest member of G, which again can be found via a recursive call to select, i.e., return select(G,k-(L.size()+E.size()).

Deterministic Quick Select (Blum, Floyd, Rivest, Pratt, Tarjan)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, if on each recursion we happen to randomly select the smallest member of the vector of values, then all values other than that pivot will be in G, so the recursions will go n deep requiring O(n^2) comparisons. To force, rather than simply expect, the number of comparisons to be linear in the size of the input, we proceed as above, but, to select our pivot, we partition V into quintuples, find the median of each of those quintuple, and select the median of those medians, i.e.:

Clearly, at least half of the medians will now be in G along with their respective above-median
quintuple-mates. So at least 30% of the members of V are in the union of G and E, i.e., at most 70%
of the members of V are in L. Similarly, at most 70% of the members of V are in G.

To aid conceptualization, imagine an array whose columns are those quintuples each order in
decreasing order, top to bottom. And imagine that those quintuples are arranged in order of
increasing median, left to right.

SORTED QUINTUPLES ORDERED BY MEDIANS </br>
ABOVE -> * * * g g g g</br>
ABOVE -> * * * g g g g</br>
MEDIANS -> l ... l ... l p g ... g ... g</br>
BELOW -> l l l l * * *</br>
BELOW -> l l l l * * * </br>

Mergesort
---------
---------

Implement the template functions mergesort and merge as presented in the Weiss text. Do not associate them with a class, implement them as utility functions in a file named Mergesort.H. Then include Mergesort.H in your main.cc.

We must be able to call your function in the following manner:
vector<string> result = mergesort(v); – where v is an already defined vector of strings. Similarly,
your function must also accept and return vectors of type int.

Testing
-------
-------

Produce several test files for use in measuring the performance of the algorithms. Your test files
should be of at least two primitive data types, string and int. You can generate random sequences
of strings and integers at http://www.random.org/strings/ and http://www.random.org/integers/,
repectively. You will also need to add functionality for counting the number of comparisons and the
number of data movements for a particular run of the algorithm being tested. Another statistic you
will measure is the number of recursive calls made for the execution of a particular function. Test
input sizes of increasing and large N. A general approach would be to have input sequences that are
mostly-ordered, mostly-random, random, monotonically increasing, and monotonically decreasing.

Report
------
------

For each sorting algorithm answer the following questions. Justify your answers with Graphs (see
below) and references to specific test cases.
<ol>
	<li>What is the worst-case running time of the sorting algorithm? Explain. </li>
	<li>What is the average-case running time of the sorting algorithm? Explain. </li>
	<li>What is the best-case running time of the sorting algorithm? Explain. </li>
	<li>Is the sorting algorithm stable? If not, why? </li>
</ol>

* Graphs - You should produce plots of input-size v. comparisons, input-size v. data movements,
input-size v. number of recursive calls for each algorithm and pivot combination. Include your plots
and their associated data in table format in a single excel file named plots.xls.
