Assignment 2

For this assignment, you will write a program to find the smallest word ladder given a start word and an end word. To keep things simple, you will only be working with 5 letter words.

The program will take as command line arguments the name of the dictionary file, the start word, and the end word and output to standard output the word ladder, e.g. ($a.out words5.dict brave heart). The output must start with the start word and end with the end word, and output no other characters other than whitespace. We will have a program that will take your output in this format as its input and verify you have a valid word ladder.
